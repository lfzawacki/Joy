Ok, so this code is very simple and is just some practice with github.
I'll be using it to do some cool stuff in the place I work, but there's nothing fancy here.

* It readys input from a joystick using glut callbacks;
* It has a joy.conf file where you can configure the buttons and it's functions;
* The 'API' is reading an entire boolean array of the buttons;
* Really there's nothing more.
